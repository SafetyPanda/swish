# Swish

Unix Shell written in Swift

#### Disclaimer:
This is a in a prealpha state and not recommended as a shell replacement!
Use at your own risk!

#### Issues:
Big ones are:
- /usr/bin/local isn't being returned when path is being searched.
- piping probably is broken
- arguments aren't working (just not implemented). Catches first argument to find path. Just need to catch the others.
AND SO MUCH MORE.

#### Features To Be Implemented:
- [] Tab-Completion
- [] Shell Customization
- [] Piping
- [] POSIX compatible
- [x] Much more.
